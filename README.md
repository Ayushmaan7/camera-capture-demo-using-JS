# Camera Capture Demo

This project demonstrates how to access a device's camera using JavaScript and capture a photo using the MediaDevices API and the Canvas API.

## Features

- Access the camera feed directly in the browser.
- Capture a photo from the camera feed.
- Display the captured photo on a canvas element.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayushmaan7/camera-capture-demo.git
  ```
2. Open the index.html file in your browser (preferably Chrome or Edge).

3. Allow camera access when prompted.

4. Click the "Capture Photo" button to take a snapshot.


This demo works best in Chrome and Edge as they fully support the MediaDevices API.
